Pull-Up Counter - This app is to count the number of pull-ups. Supports 2 modes(DEFINE REPETITIONS, Free Mode), DEFINE REPETITIONS specifies the number of times it needs to reach. After entering one mode, it will prompt you to shake the phone first before you can officially start the counter. In Define Repetition mode, you need to enter nmax after shaking. If you do not enter nmax, you can start the exercise directly, and the interface will notice you to input nmax again. There is a stop button to stop the counter if the user does not finish the nmax repetitions. To start again, shake the phone. When the counter reaches nmax repetitions, play a sound of your choice to notify the user. Free mode is similar with DEFINE REPETITIONS.
